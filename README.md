keithley-gpib
=============

Python program to control the keithley smu using gpib interface

This program depends on the Linux GPIB project:
http://linux-gpib.sourceforge.net/

The Linux GPIB package should be installed to make sure that the required "gpib" python module and required drivers are present in our system.

Also make sure that the Keithley Source Measure Unit is properly wired and
powered.

More information about the GPIB (General Purpose Interface Bus) is available 
here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE-488
